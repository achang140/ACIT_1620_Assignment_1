### Note Taking App 
The goal of the assignment is to create a note taking app with 2 html files (index.html & note.html) that link to a CSS file (style.css). The colours were chosen from Rosé Pine website. In both html files, 4 colours used and a Google font (Domine) is added. A media query (max-width: 480) is created for responsive development, mainly targeting mobile screen sizes.
